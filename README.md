I was taking Calc 3 and needed to learn all the surfaces. Each shape has four things: equation, drawing, description, and name.

I went to Quizlet, but it only allows one answer per flashcard. If I put “ellipsoid” on the front, the back could only show the equation or the drawing or the description. To get all four, I’d have to make four separate cards.

Even in Quizlet’s Match mode, dragging the “ellipsoid” card onto the correct formula wouldn’t work if that card was only linked to the drawing. Anki didn’t fix it either.

So I built this tool to let you connect any representation to any other, and finally practice the surfaces in a way that actually makes sense.
